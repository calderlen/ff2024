# Fantasy Football Neural Network
####  by Calder Lenhart

## Description
This neural network predicts [fantasy football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy_football_(American)) PPR scores for the quarterback (QB), running back (RB), wide receiver (WR) and tight end (TE) positions.

## Resources
* This program uses [keras](https://keras.io/) to constuct the neural network
* [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are used to structure the data
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is used to plot the results
* All data is sourced from [Pro Football Reference](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/)
